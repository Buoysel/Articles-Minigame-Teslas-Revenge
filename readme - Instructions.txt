1. The game's exe file is found in the root directory under the name "Articles Minigame.exe"

2. When the game begins, three columns will be presented:
    -The first column will present an article the player must read
    -The second column will talk about the article, such as take a quote or
    make a summary
    -The third column gives the player the opportunity to give their input based
     on the second column.
        * If the second column was a direct quote from the article, the player
          pressed 'Q',
        * If the it was a paraphrase, the player presses 'P',
        * and if it was a summary, the player presses 'S'.

3. The game will decide if the player was correct or not.
    -If the player was correct, this ends the game. (It would send the player
     back to the lobby in Tesla's Revenge, but here the screen will simply hang.)
    -If the player was incorrect, they will be sent to the Library Help desk, where they can see what the correct
    answer was.
      * The player is also given the option to read up more on what a
        paraphrase, quote, or summary are.
      * Or the player can simply press 'Enter' and be sent back to the game to
        try another article.
