Game Elements:
	-From the sketch and the information listed above, all the game elements will
	probably use Unity's text element. This, of course, does not include the
	background, which I'll probably draw up myself.
	
	-No buttons involved, but keypresses will be used to operate the game when
	 appropriate.
	 	- if (Input.GetKeyDown("Return")) {;}
	 	- if (Input.GetKeyDown("P")) {;}
	 	- if (Input.GetKeyDown("S")) {;}
	 	- if (Input.GetKeyDown("Q")) {;}

			-Paraphrase List?
			-Summary List?
			-Quote List?
			
		-A list of articles
